Raspberry Pi 8 bit parallel ili9325 LCD driver 

This is mostly a fork from the ili9341 driver.

The display identifies its self as a 0x6809 which is the same as 0x9325.  Except a couple of unused registers.<br>
I have had it running at about 16fps on a Pi-Zero.  The code is not neat, but works.



Installing:<br>
   download the source<br>
   run make<br>
   sudo insmod ./ili9325.ko<br>
this will create /dev/fb1.<br>
Use the new framebuffer (https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/Framebuffer-use)<br>

The photos folder shows the different pinout.
